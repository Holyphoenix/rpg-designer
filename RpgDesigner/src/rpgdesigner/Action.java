 * This class should make it easy to interpret what the events are doing for the 
 * game engine as well as better organize the events.  It should be pretty straight
 * forward.  To set the correct settings for type and action on the events, use the 
 * actual Action object.  So for an NPC speech you can do: 
 * Action action1 = new Action(action1.TYPE_NPC, action1.ACTION_SPEECH);
